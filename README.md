## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! My portfolio gives you a short description about myself, a portrait, a few projects that I'm particularly proud of, links to contact me, and links to see my LinkedIn and resume. I am pretty happy with how the design has turned out. However, if I could improve something, it would be the responsiveness of the media queries when accessing on lower resolutions.
